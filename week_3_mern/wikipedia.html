    <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System.It is a massive,glowing sphere of hot gases,
        mainly hydrogen and helium.Its gravity holds the entire Solar System together,keeping planets,
        asteroids,comets,and other objects in orbit.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within 
        large molecular cloud.Most of this material gathered in the center,while the rest flattened 
        into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Diameter:</b> About 1.39 million kilometers (109 times that of Earth).</li>
        <li><b>Mass:</b> About 330,000 times the mass of Earth.</li>
        <li><b>Surface Temperature:</b> Around 5,500째C (9,932째F).</li>
        <li><b>Core Temperature:</b> Around 15 million 째C (27 million 째F).</li>
        <li><b>Composition:</b> About 74% hydrogen,24% helium,and 2% heavier elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Importance to Life on Earth</h3>
    <p>
        The Sun provides light and heat necessary for life.Plants use sunlight for photosynthesis,
        which forms the base of Earth's food chains.Solar energy also drives weather,ocean currents,
        and the water cycle.
    </p>
    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sun makes up about 99.86% of the mass of the entire Solar System.</li>
        <li>It takes around 8 minutes and 20 seconds for sunlight to reach Earth.</li>
        <li>The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles.</li>
        <li>It will eventually expand into a red giant and then shrink into a white dwarf.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Structure of the Sun</h3>
    <p>
        The Sun has several layers:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Core:</b> The innermost part where nuclear fusion occurs.</li>
        <li><b>Radiative Zone:</b> Energy slowly moves outward through radiation.</li>
        <li><b>Convective Zone:</b> Hot plasma circulates, carrying energy to the surface.</li>
        <li><b>Photosphere:</b> The visible surface of the Sun.</li>
        <li><b>Chromosphere and Corona:</b> Outer layers visible during solar eclipses.</li>
    </ol>
